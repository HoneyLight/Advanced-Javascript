// class is used to create a model that hold a particular activity.
// <!-- class is a like a model that holds everything i want to perform eg the method, etc and they are all grouped together without scaterring everything and no other variable can use the functions if its not created inside that class -->

// <!-- constructor is used to store your variables so that you can refer to them whenever yoy want to use them and its triggered using the 'new' key word and it must be inside the 'class'. -->
